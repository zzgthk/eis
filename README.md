# eis

an easy install script for lnmp(linux + nginx + mysql + php).

the goal of this script is to install those env in a commonly used linux env for example ubuntu and centos, and for the latest one or two year released ones(which will simpilfy the compatible of the script).

* nginx: we can use openresty, which can download and direct run.
* mysql,php we must download the source code and compile, but will cause something bad like some package or lib dependency, so who has a better solution?


for this project, I also have a problem, if yum or apt already solve the install dependency, why when we install a development env also so diffcult, especially when we want to custome the package install dir? Is there a better way for package manager?
